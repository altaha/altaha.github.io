<p>My name is Ahmed. I do Software and Computer Engineering things. Based in Toronto!</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. Also I have recently completed a part-time Masters in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto. Never stop learning!</p>

<p>After finishing undergrad I worked at Qualcomm, implementing Linux Kernel device drivers that went into some of the most iconic Android devices. My work was primarily of embedded nature and using C. After almost 3 years at Qualcomm I joined TopHat at the end of 2014, an ed-tech startup in Toronto that is a leader in classroom engagement. My role is a full stack web software developer, using Python and Javascript, which has been a big and exciting change and really allowed me to grow as a software engineer.</p>

<p>I'm excited by technology and the technical aspects of things, but also interested in building products and putting the user first!</p>
