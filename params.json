Based in Toronto!\r\n\r\nI graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. I have also been working on a part-time Masters in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto. Never stop learning!\r\n\r\nAfter finishing undergrad I worked at Qualcomm, implementing Linux Kernel device drivers that went into some of the most iconic Android devices. My work was primarily of embedded nature and using C. Since 2015, I joined TopHat, an ed-tech startup in Toronto that is a leader in classroom engagement. My role is a full stack web software developer, using Python and Javascript, which has been a big and exciting departure.\r\n\r\nI'm excited by technology and the technical aspects of things, but also interested in building products and putting the user first!\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFollow me on GitHub @altaha\r\n\r\nYou can also connect with me on [Linkedin](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/aaltaha), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AhmedAlTaha)\r\n\r\n### Resume\r\nTBD: Add a link to my resume\r\n\r\n### Blog\r\nTBD\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
